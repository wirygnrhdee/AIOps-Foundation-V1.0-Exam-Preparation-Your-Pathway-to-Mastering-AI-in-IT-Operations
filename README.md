	Key Topics to Focus on for Exam Preparation
</h2>
<strong>1. AIOps Fundamentals</strong><br />
Understanding the basics of AIOps is critical for passing the exam. The exam will explore how AIOps has evolved over time, differentiating it from traditional IT Operations Analytics (ITOA), and the various stages of an AIOps system. You’ll need to grasp how AI is applied to IT operations and how it benefits IT teams in terms of automation and predictive insights.<br />
<br />
<strong>2. AIOps in the Organization</strong><br />
In this section, you'll learn how AIOps integrates into broader organizational frameworks. It's important to understand AIOps' role in DevOps, site reliability engineering (SRE), security operations, and its impact on system complexity. The exam will assess your ability to articulate how AIOps drives digital transformation and streamlines IT workflows within an enterprise environment.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. Core Technologies: Big Data</strong><br />
AIOps heavily relies on Big Data to analyze vast amounts of information from different sources. In this section, you’ll explore the concept of Big Data, including its Five V’s (Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity, and Value), key characteristics, and how AIOps uses Big Data to process and extract meaningful insights. You’ll also learn about different types of data sources and how they feed into AIOps systems.<br />
<br />
<strong>4. Core Technologies: Machine Learning (ML)</strong><br />
Machine learning is a cornerstone of AIOps. Understanding the role of AI and ML in AIOps is vital for your exam preparation. You’ll need to differentiate between supervised and unsupervised learning, learn about training models, and explore how ML compares to traditional analytics methods. The future of AIOps will increasingly rely on machine learning algorithms, so this topic is essential for anyone wanting to master AIOps technologies.<br />
<br />
